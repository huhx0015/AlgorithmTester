/**
 * Created by Michael Yoon Huh on 4/3/2017.

 * Finds the smallest index in the original array for which the replacement array has the least distruptive range.

 * Ex. Given original array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and a replacement of [5, 8, 1], the least disruptive range starts at index 2 in
 * the original array (3, 4, 5). We compare the differences, (3 vs 5 = 2, 4 vs 8 = 4, 5 vs 1 = 4, for which the total
 * is 10. If we compare this against the very first index [1, 2, 3], (1 vs 5 = 4, 2 vs 8 = 6, 3 vs 1 = 2, for which the
 * total is 12.), the total distance is higher than the set starting at index 2, meaning it's more "disruptive."
